/**
 * Renders an image in tiles and stitches them into one.
 *
 * The image renders at [SNAPSHOT_SUPERSAMPLE] into a surface of its own and is resolved and read back
 * synchronously, in tiles of at most [tileEdge] output pixels (and never past what the device can
 * allocate).  A tile is the same camera re-centered on its own rectangle, so the pieces meet exactly:
 * tile edges fall on whole output pixels, and the resolve never averages across one.
 *
 * Backend-neutral, and it knows nothing of what is drawn: [renderTile] draws one tile, and this decides
 * only where each tile sits and where its pixels land.
 *
 * Must run on the render thread with the device's context current, between frames.
 *
 * @param RenderDevice   device         The backend to render and read back through.
 * @param ViewportCamera camera         The view: the world point at the image's center and the output
 *   pixels per world unit.
 * @param Int            width          The image width in pixels.
 * @param Int            height         The image height in pixels.
 * @param Int            tileEdge       The largest tile edge in output pixels.
 * @param Function       shouldContinue Asked before each tile; false abandons the capture.
 * @param Function       renderTile     Draws one tile: the target to draw into, the tile's camera (already
 *   carrying the supersample in its zoom), and the framebuffer width and height to draw at.
 * @return RasterImage? The pixels, top row first, or null when the capture was abandoned.
