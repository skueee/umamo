/**
 * Every key the window-space [region] encloses, across every section.
 *
 * Resolved against the lanes' own reported bounds rather than computed from row heights: sections fold,
 * groups collapse, and the sheet scrolls, so the only reliable answer to "where is this row" is the one
 * the row gave during layout.  A mark counts when its lane overlaps the region vertically AND its drawn
 * position falls inside it horizontally.
 *
 * Two things have to match what is ON SCREEN rather than what is in the model, or the marquee selects keys
 * the user cannot see:
 *
 *   - The rows walked are the FLATTENED, currently-visible ones ([flattenTrackRows] with the sheet's own
 *     expand state, skipping folded sections), not the whole tree.  laneBounds is never pruned - a lane
 *     that leaves composition simply stops reporting - so a collapsed group's children keep their last
 *     rectangles forever, and walking the tree blind would keep hitting them.
 *   - The axis is the WINDOWED one, so a zoomed sheet maps a mark to the pixel it is actually drawn at.
 *     The full-range axis put every mark at the wrong x the moment the sheet was not framed to the whole
 *     domain.
 *
 * Internal rather than private so the resolution can be tested without a composition: it is pure over plain
 * data, and a wrong answer here - an un-windowed axis, or a walk that reaches collapsed rows - is a
 * silently wrong selection, not a crash, so a direct test is the only way to catch it.
 *
 * @param Rect region The marquee, in window coordinates.
 * @param List projections Each targeted parameter and its tracks.
 * @param Map laneBounds Each row key's last reported window bounds.
 * @param Float markRadiusPx The sheet's mark radius, which is also its lane end inset.
 * @param TrackWindow window The visible slice of each parameter's range, shared by every section.
 * @param Set<String> expandedKeys The open group rows, which decide which lanes exist.
 * @param Set<ParameterId> collapsedParameters The folded sections, whose rows are not on screen at all.
 * @return Set<TrackKeyRef> The enclosed keys.
