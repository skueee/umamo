 * Tells the reveal which change of the active selection is the outliner's own.  A selection made anywhere
 * else is revealed: its branches open and the list scrolls to it.  A click on a row selects without
 * scrolling, so the list does not move under the pointer.
 *
 * A click marks the active target it is about to produce, and the reveal asks whether the change it woke
 * for is that one.  The mark is a value, not a flag.  A click can leave the active target as it was (a
 * click on the row that is active already), and then no reveal wakes to take a flag down: a flag left
 * standing would silence the next selection made elsewhere instead.  A mark that does not match the
 * change is simply dropped.
