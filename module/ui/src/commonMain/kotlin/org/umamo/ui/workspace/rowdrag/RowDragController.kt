/*
 * Row drag-and-drop, shared by every space that drags rows (the outliner, the parameters panel, the
 * Sources table): the transient drag state and hit-test here, the part a row plays in a drag in
 * RowDragRole.kt, the Escape seam in RowDragCancel.kt, the long-press pickup in RowDragGesture.kt, the
 * cursor chip in RowDragLabel.kt, and the drop-target ring in RowDropHighlight.kt.  What a drag MEANS -
 * which rows may take a drop, and what a release does - stays with each space and its :edit rules;
 * nothing here knows a payload's kind.
 *
 * The pointer moves on every frame of a drag, and what a move changes is small: the chip's place, and
 * at most the two rows the target passes between.  So nothing reads the pointer while composing.  The
 * chip reads it while it is laid out, and a row reads the part it plays, which changes only when the
 * row's own part does.
