/**
 * The host's route into the shell's quit guard.
 *
 * The host owns the ways out that the shell never sees: the window's close button, the OS's own quit, and
 * Android's back gesture.  Each hands its exit to [request], and the shell, once composed, installs the
 * guard that decides whether the exit runs at once or waits on the unsaved-changes prompt.  Before the
 * shell installs anything, and after it is gone, an exit runs directly, because there is no document
 * whose edits could be lost.
 *
 * The guard also tells the host whether work is running that an exit must wait for ([workRunning]), so a host
 * that lets some exits bypass the guard - Android keeps the platform's own back behavior for a clean document -
 * routes them through it while that work runs.
