/**
 * The panel's writes to the pose: a preview that records no undo step, the commit that ends a gesture as
 * one step, and the discrete edits built from the two.
 *
 * Parameters are LOCKED while in Edit mode: Edit mode edits the neutral state of the base mesh and is
 * pinned to the neutral pose (the viewport shows rest via a display-only override), so no scrub may move
 * the session pose out from under it.  The pose seam refuses such a write from anyone; the lock here is
 * the panel's own, and what it adds is that a refused write never reaches the values the panel holds.
 * The sliders show the rest pose meanwhile, as the viewport does, and the Object-mode pose they hold
 * shows again on exit.
 * Range, link, rename, create, and delete are document edits rather than pose writes, so none of them
 * comes through this class.
 *
 * The lock is a constructor value, not a read at write time.  A writer stands for one state of the lock
 * and is replaced when the mode changes, so a callback holding a writer can never act on a lock that has
 * since flipped.
 *
 * @param LiveParamsHandle? liveParams The pose seam the writes go through, or null with no posable document.
 * @param Boolean locked Whether every write is refused.
 * @param Function recordLocalValue Called with each previewed (id, value) ahead of the seam, so a panel
 *   showing the value moves with its own write.  Does nothing by default.
