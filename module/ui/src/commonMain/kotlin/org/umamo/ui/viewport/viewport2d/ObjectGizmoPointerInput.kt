/**
 * The Object overlay's pointer loop.  Every event records the pointer, then goes to exactly one branch: the
 * modal transform while an operator is latched here, the circle brush while it is armed here, and
 * otherwise the click pick and the box select, armed or not.  While another area owns a gesture (or a UV
 * operator runs, which never belongs to a viewport), or Zoom Region is armed here, the loop takes nothing.
 * Whatever takes the area over mid-drag - another area, a transform, the circle tool, Zoom Region -
 * abandons an in-flight box first.
 *
 * It runs for the life of its pointerInput, keyed on the area, and keeps the arguments it started with:
 * each is fixed for the area's life or a State holder read per event.
 *
 * @param String areaId The overlay's area.
 * @param EditorSession session The session owning the latches and the selection.
 * @param ObjectModalTransform modalTransform The area's modal transform (its gesture state and commit side).
 * @param MarqueeSelectController<Selection> marquee The area's box / circle machinery.
 * @param ObjectPickController objectPick The area's click pick and box flows.
 * @param State<ViewportCamera> liveCamera The area camera.
 * @param State<IntSize> liveSize The area size in pixels.
