 * when it is picked up or put down, when the target arrives on it or leaves it, and when the pointer
 * crosses from one of its bands to another.  Read it in the scope that draws the row's drag feedback.
 *
 * @param String   rowKey  The row's stable key.
 * @param Function bandFor The space's drop rule for this row, as [RowDragController.roleOf] takes it.
 *   Read through state, so a rule built again for the same row starts nothing over.
 * @return State<RowDragRole> The row's part.
