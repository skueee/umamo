/**

 *
 * @param ShellControllers controllers The shell's controllers: the root's focus and the states that trigger
 *   a reclaim.
 * @param String           languageTag The active UI language, whose every switch rebuilds the shell's content.

	// THE focus-reclaim effect.  Compose leaves focus null whenever the focused node leaves composition
	// (a join/split disposing the focused leaf, a closing overlay/popup/menu/inline editor taking its
	// field along), and a null focus silently kills every keyboard shortcut until the next click - so the
	// root must reclaim focus after each such transition.  One effect keyed on every reclaim trigger:
	//  - structuralEditCount: area-tree edits and popup-invoked workspace CRUD;
	//  - selfFocusedOverlayOpen / inline edit: reclaim when the palette, preferences, Help dialogs, or an
	//    inline rename CLOSE (while one is open it owns focus, so the effect waits);
	//  - topmostModalAlert: the confirm dialog, the file-open alert, the app layer's alerts, the export report,
	//    and the repack refusal report do NOT own focus - root focus is (re)claimed on open too, so their
	//    Escape/Enter route through the modal ladder while open.  Keyed on the topmost arrival rather than on
	//    whether any is open, because they queue: a dismissed dialog can take its focused text along while the
	//    next queued one shows, and nothing else would reclaim focus for it;
	//  - menu-bar close: an open menu's popup holds focus and its teardown takes it along.
	// The two-frame wait lets a closing popup's teardown finish stealing focus first - an immediate
	// request would be nulled right back out (the menu bar demonstrably needs this; it is harmless for
	// the other triggers).

	// regain.  Skipped while an overlay that owns its own focus is up (the reclaim effect above covers
	// their close); the guard reads the live state inside the collector, never captures.  A modal alert does
	// not own focus - its Escape and Enter route through the ladder on the root - so it is no reason to skip:
	// copying an alert's text out to another window and coming back is the everyday case.

	// rebuild has settled, the root takes focus back.  Unless something under it already holds focus by
	// then - an overlay that focuses its own field when it composes keeps it - since nothing was lost.
