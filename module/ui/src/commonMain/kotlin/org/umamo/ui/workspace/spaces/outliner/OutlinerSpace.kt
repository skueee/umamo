/*
 * The Outliner space.  This file is the body's entry point; the rest of the package, by role:
 *
 *   OutlinerHeaderControls.kt   the area header's controls: the name search and the filter dropdown
 *   OutlinerViewState.kt        the view state the header and the body share
 *   OutlinerRowViews.kt         one tree row: its context-menu frame, its body, and the ancestry guides
 *   OutlinerRowSlots.kt         the chevron, the type icon, the eye, and the pointer a row is built from
 *   OutlinerRowDrag.kt          the drop insertion line and the drop dispatch
 *   OutlinerRowMetrics.kt       the measurements every row shares, and the one width the rows are fixed to
 *   OutlinerMenus.kt            the entries of a row's context menu
 *   OutlinerLabels.kt           the localized chrome
 *
 * and, holding no composable so commonTest pins them directly:
 *
 *   OutlinerTree.kt             the unified tree, its filtering, and the Shift range rule
 *   OutlinerRows.kt             the visible rows, the path to a node, and what a click does to the selection
 *   OutlinerRevealStandDown.kt  which change of the selection is the outliner's own, and so not revealed
 *
 * The row drag kit it drags with is org.umamo.ui.workspace.rowdrag, and the hover preview it pops is
 * org.umamo.ui.workspace.spaces.RowHoverPreview; both are shared with the Sources space.  The drop rules a
 * drag lands by live in :edit (OutlinerTreeEdits.kt).

/**
 * The outliner space: the unified Blender-style tree that folds Cubism's split Part and Deformer panels
 * into one.  A single puppet root holds the Armature deformer hierarchy followed by the parts, each part
 * listing its drawables then its sub-parts.  Reads the open document's puppet from [LocalPuppet] (empty
 * state when nothing is loaded).  Branches start collapsed (only the root is open); rows dim when hidden
 * or sketch and select through [LocalSelection] (plain click replaces, Ctrl / Cmd toggles, Shift adds).
 * A selection made elsewhere (a viewport pick) reveals its row - ancestors expand and the list scrolls
 * to it - but a click inside the outliner never scrolls the list.  Clearing the search reveals the active
 * selection the same way, so a row picked out of the results is not stranded behind a branch that closes
 * again.  The AREA header carries the name search and the filter dropdown (outlinerHeaderControls,
 * sharing this body's OutlinerViewState through [scope]); names never wrap, so a horizontal scroll
 * reaches long ones.
 *
 * This composable is the wiring: it derives the tree and its visible rows, holds the list, the rename
 * state, and the drag state, runs the two reveal effects, and hands each row to [OutlinerRowView].  The
 * chrome comes from [outlinerLabels], the rows' width from [outlinerContentWidth], and a drop lands
 * through [performOutlinerDrop].
 *
 * @param AreaScope scope The hosting area's scope carrying the shared view state.
 * @param Modifier modifier The layout modifier.
