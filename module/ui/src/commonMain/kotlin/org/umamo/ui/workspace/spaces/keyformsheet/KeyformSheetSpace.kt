/*
 * The keyform sheet space.  This file is the body's entry point; the rest of the package, by role:
 *
 *   KeyformSheetHeaderControls.kt   the area header's controls: the track-kind filter
 *   KeyformSheetViewState.kt        the view state the header and the body share
 *   KeyformSheetSection.kt          one parameter's section: its header, its tracks, and the empty notice
 *   KeyformSheetMenus.kt            the entries of the lane and row label context menus
 *   KeyformSheetLabels.kt           the localized chrome
 *
 * and, free of Compose so commonTest pins them directly:
 *
 *   KeyformSheetRows.kt             the projection of a rig into sheet rows, the one place the sheet reads the model
 *   KeyformSheetSelection.kt        what a click does to the key selection, how its refs resolve, and the group drag
 *   KeyformSheetMarquee.kt          which keys a box-select band encloses
 *
 * The track widgets it draws with are org.umamo.ui.tracks, which knows nothing of parameters or keyforms;
 * everything that does know lives here.  What a key edit does to the key selection lives in :edit
 * (KeyformKeySelection.kt).
 */

/**
 * The keyform sheet: for each parameter targeted in the Parameters panel, one track per (item, channel)
 * keyed on it, with the marks laid out across that parameter's authored range.
 *
 * One SECTION per targeted parameter, stacked under a single scroll.  A linked pad targets both of its
 * axes at once, so a single-section sheet would show only half of what the panel says is selected.
 *
 * Within a section, tracks hang under a collapsible per-owner group row - one track per CHANNEL rather
 * than per item, because that is the thing the per-channel split made possible and the thing this sheet
 * exists to make visible: an item can key opacity on a parameter its geometry never touches.  A collapsed
 * group still shows its subtree's key positions, so folding hides detail, never the presence of keys.
 *
 * Clicking a mark scrubs the parameter onto it and selects it; dragging a mark that is not selected selects
 * it in place of the selection as the drag starts, and a drag then moves the whole selection - a folded
 * group's summary mark stands for every key stacked under it (a key may cross its neighbours, and stops only
 * at the parameter's range); Delete removes the selection as one undo step; right-clicking a lane inserts a
 * key there or removes the one under the pointer; Box Select (B) arms a marquee that adds the keys it
 * encloses to the selection.
 *
 * This composable is the wiring: it derives the sections, holds the scroll and the drag cursor, registers
 * the area's command surface, and hands each section to [KeyformSheetSection].
 *
 * @param AreaScope scope The hosting area's scope.
