/**
 * Marks a running session's log with an operating-system lock on one byte far past anything the log will hold.
 *
 * The locked byte lies past the content on purpose.  Windows locks are mandatory for the range they cover, so a
 * lock over the text would fail the session's own writes (they go through a different handle) and block a
 * text editor opened from Help > Open Log Folder; a byte no one reads or writes blocks nothing.  The lock goes
 * away with the process however it ends, so a crashed session leaves no mark behind and no file to clean up.
 *
 * On Linux and macOS the lock is a POSIX record lock: it belongs to the process, and closing ANY descriptor the
 * process has on the file drops it.  So nothing else in the editor may open a running session's own log - the
 * pruning probe runs before the session's file exists, and exporting the log writes from the in-memory buffer.
